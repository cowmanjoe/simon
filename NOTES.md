# Notes

My main difficulties with this task were creating the onClick function so that it would behave properly if the user failed. This was a bit of a challenge because the game had to be reset and also locked so that the user wouldn't cause an extra failure and start a second game. I solved this issue with the proper use of setTimeout to disable and enable the keys. Although I could have restarted the game immediately, I thought the user experience would be better if the game paused for a second before starting a new one.
