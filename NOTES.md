# Notes

My main difficulties with this task were creating the onClick function so that it would behave properly if the user failed. This was a bit of a challenge because the game had to be reset and also locked so that the user wouldn't cause an extra failure and start a second game. I solved this issue with the proper use of setTimeout to disable and enable the keys. Although I could have restarted the game immediately, I thought the user experience would be better if the game paused for a second before starting a new one.

Another challenge was checking that the user was playing the correct notes. For that, I made 2 global variables: one for storing the correct pattern and one for storing the user's input at each round. At every click, I checked that the user played the next correct note and added it to the user input array. If the user's input array was the same size as the correct pattern array, then they successfully completed the round. At this point, the notes would lock and the pattern would play again, adding a new randomly generated note.
